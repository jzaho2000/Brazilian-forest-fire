# Brazilian-forest-fire

This was my AI in Business course project in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Science. Brazilian forest fires did sound interesting data, but it did lack weather 
information. Because of that I did download Brazilian forest fire data from address <br />
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gustavomodelli/forest-fires-in-brazil">https://www.kaggle.com/gustavomodelli/forest-fires-in-brazil</a>.<br />

Because this data did not contain weather information, so I downloaded weather data from address<br /> 
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/saraivaufc/automatic-weather-stations-brazil?select=automatic_weather_stations_inmet_brazil_2000_2021.csv">
https://www.kaggle.com/saraivaufc/automatic-weather-stations-brazil?select=automatic_weather_stations_inmet_brazil_2000_2021.csv</a>.<br /> 

This weather information file did contain 612 weather stations hourly data from years 2000 to 2021. To compare data with forest fire, I did havew to combine two datasets and 
then view data in <a href="https://bigml.com/">Big ML</a>.
